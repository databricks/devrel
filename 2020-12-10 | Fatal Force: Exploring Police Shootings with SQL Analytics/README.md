## Tech Talk: Fatal Force: Exploring Police Shootings with SQL Analytics

2020-12-10 | This folder contains the notebooks used in this tutorial.

Download the `Police.dbc` file, and import it into your Databricks workspace. There you will find all the notebooks necessary to reproduce our analysis. Please follow the steps outlined in the notebooks for how to import the necessary data/tables into Databricks.

Alternatively, if you do not have access to a Databricks workspace, you can also download the individual `.html` files and open them in your browser to view the notebooks. 

Additionally, we've included a `state_mappings.csv` file that maps state abbreviations to state names to make the analysis a bit more readible.
