Delta Lake’s transaction log brings high reliability, performance, and ACID compliant transactions to data lakes. But exactly how does it accomplish this? Working through concrete examples, we will take a close look at how the transaction logs are managed and leveraged by Delta to supercharge data lakes.

This tutorial notebook was developed using open source Delta on an open source environment.
